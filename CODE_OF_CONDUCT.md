# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of the ICDFA-Open-Labs community. We value the participation of every individual and want to ensure that every contributor has a positive and respectful experience.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being patient and understanding with beginners
- Helping others learn and grow

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Discrimination based on race, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, ethnicity, religion, or experience level
- Intimidation or threats of any kind

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at conduct@icdfa.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Consequences

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in:

1. **Warning:** A private message explaining the violation and expected behavior
2. **Temporary Ban:** Temporary removal from the community (24 hours to 30 days)
3. **Permanent Ban:** Permanent removal from the community
